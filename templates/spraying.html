        Any substance or combination of substances that is intended to harm or
        interfere with the production, processing, storage, transport, or

      <h1>Types of Pesticides</h1>
      <h2>Herbicides</h2>
      <p>
        Herbicides stop the growth of weeds that can rob crops of the nutrients
        they need to grow. Furthermore, among the chemicals used as herbicides
        in agriculture are 2,4-D, Clethodim, Glyphosate, Bentazon, and
        Clethodim.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Insecticides</h2>
      <p>
        Insecticides, as the name implies, target the nervous system of insects
        to prevent them from inhibiting or reproducing. Among the chemicals used
        as insecticides include organophosphate, carbamates, nicotinoids,
        fumigants, and biological.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Fungicides</h2>
      <p>
        Fungicides aid in totally eliminating fungi by preventing their growth.
        Additionally, they quickly decompose in soil with air present. A few
        forms of insecticides that are also employed as fungicides include
        maneb, nabam, and cycloheximide.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Rodenticides</h2>
      <p>
        They are chemicals that are used to keep rodent populations under
        control, including fish, birds, and mammals that can damage crops as
        well as rats, mice, and gophers. Additionally, a few examples of
        rodenticides include chlorophacinone, diphacinone, brodifacoum, and
        bromadiolone.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Larvicides</h2>
      <p>
        Larvicides are pesticides that prevent vector-borne illnesses like
        malaria by limiting or controlling mosquito larvae or breeding.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Bactericides</h2>
      <p>
        Pesticides eradicate hazardous microorganisms from crops and livestock
        or prevent their spread.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Molluscicides</h2>
      <p>
        pesticides that typically prevent mollusks like snails, slugs, and
        others from living in an area or from spreading there.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Algaecides</h2>
      <p>
        For increased crop output, these herbicides destroy algae or prevent
        their growth. Now that we have a list of pesticides and their
        applications, let's explore the persistent and biodegradable pesticide
        categories.
      </p>
      <h1>Fertilizers</h1>
      <p>
        Fertilizers are natural or manmade compounds that are used to provide
        nutrients to plants. It is used to boost crop productivity in
        agricultural fields. Farmers that engage in agricultural techniques or
        farming utilise fertiliser on a daily basis to boost crop yield.
        Fertilizers are items that are required for the improvement of soil and
        the retention of water for plant growth. It gives plants nutrients like
        nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus to help them grow.
      </p>
      <h2>Urea</h2>
      <p>
        Urea fertilizer, commonly known as 46-0-0, is a simple or straight
        (single-element) fertilizer¬†that provides the key necessary ingredient
        nitrogen in ammonic form (NH4+). Urea can be administered to the soil as
        solid granules, prills, or pellets. Urea fertilizer¬†contains nitrogen,
        which promotes root growth. It aids in the formation of plant leaves,
        stalks, and stems. Urea fertilizer¬†gives plants a dark green color by
        creating chlorophyll. Aids in the growth of fruit, including the
        creation of immature fruit. In plants, it aids in the creation of
        carbohydrates and proteins. It also boosts the rate of absorption of all
        other necessary plant elements.

          ></b
        >
      </p>
      <h2>DAP</h2>
      <p>
        The full name of DAP fertiliser is Diamonimum Phosphate, and it is a
        popular fertiliser among farmers. It has a great nutritional value and
        is often used by farmers. The DAP is a great phosphate and nitrogen
        source. DAP has an alkaline pH and quickly dissolves in soil, releasing
        phosphate and ammonium for the plants. The DAP should not be used too
        close to the roots since the ammonium release might harm the seedlings
        and plant roots, and damage occurs when the pH exceeds 7. DAP is a great
        source of nitrogen that will be progressively transformed into nitrate
        by soil bacteria, resulting in a brief rise in pH. With adequate
        management, the differences in DAP and Monoammonium Phosphate are
        negligible or there is no change in plant development and yield owing to
        Phosphorous source. DAP is also used as a fire retardant on bushfires
        and other forest fires. After the fire is out, this becomes a nutrition
        source.

        nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It is a
        compound that is good for all soils because it is neutral in nature and
        does not leave any acidity or alkalinity in the soil. It is an excellent
        and appropriate complex for all crops for basal application. 14-35-14 is
        an excellent complex for rice, cotton, peanuts, chiles, soya bean,
        potato, and other commercial crops that require a high initial Phosphate
        level.<b

      <h2>20-20-20</h2>
      <p>
        The water-soluble fertiliser NPK 20-20-20 has a nitrogen (N), phosphorus
        (P), and potassium (K) balance of 20:20:20. It contains magnesium as
        well as trace elements. It is made with high-quality nutrients,
        resulting in high solubility and flawless assimilation. It supports
        constant development and compactness, preventing deficiencies or
        nutritional imbalances. Its balanced content of 1: 1: 1 is excellent for
        a wide variety of plants at practically every stage of development and
        can be used in a continuous or periodic manner, alternating with water
        or rain.<b

      <h2>14-14-14</h2>
      <p>
        14-14-14 fertiliser is used to provide a healthy boost to plants such as
        lawns, vegetables, flowers, and potted plants during the growing season.
        It includes the same proportions of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium
        as lower NPK fertilisers (14% N, 14% P, and 14% K). It's intended for
        medium-term crops. It has enough nutrients to feed the plant for three
        to four months. This constant flow of nutrients results in fantastically
        uniform crop development.<b

      <h2>10-26-26</h2>
      <p>
        10-26-26 is a comprehensive fertiliser that contains all three major
        plant nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Its water-soluble
        form aids in boosting crop quality and yield. It has a higher content of
        potassium, which aids in the development of plant immunity. It also
        increases soil texture and the plant's capacity to absorb nutrients
        through stronger roots. It boosts plant uptake of nutrients required for
        healthy plant growth.<b

      <h2>28-28</h2>
      <p>
        A complex fertiliser combining two important nutrients, Nitrogen at 28%
        and Phosphorus at 28%, gives crops with rapid and long-term greenness.
        With 28% nitrogen content, this is the most nitrogen-rich complex
        fertiliser. It is an excellent fertiliser for crops such as paddy,
        cotton, chilies, sugarcane, and vegetables.<b
